It's hard to get more convenient than that.<br /><br />Looking at the container, it proclaims that there are zero calories, zero sugar and zero carbs. It also says:<br /><br />""Vitamin Squeeze(tm) adds Vitamins, Nutrition, and Delicious ALL NATURAL flavor to your drinking water.""<br /><br />And although there are various vitamin additives, there are some small problems, the first being that this bright red drink that resembles <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZRZNMA"">Hawaiian Punch</a> in the Fruit Juicy Red flavor, it really doesn't taste that good, but that's a subjective opinion. And though sometimes one can learn to adapt to a new taste, this product has an aftertaste that lingers, and it's a distinctive taste that seems to dwell in the mouth, the kind that reminds one of an artificial sweetener. And according to the label, that's precisely why that aftertaste is there.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on the product label and the information page here: water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.  It's not apparent at first, as no brand name jumps out, but there's an ingredient that is probably responsible for the aftertaste: sucralose.<br /><br />Some may not know this, but sucralose is an FDA-approved artificial sweetener which goes by the trade name of Splenda, and most sources agree that it's around 600 times sweeter than sugar, so manufacturers need to use only a small amount. Sucralose shouldn't be confused with sucrose, which is basically table sugar.  While is derived from sugar, sucrose is not a component in this sweetener. Sucralose is made by adding chlorine to sucrose, yet the sucrose itself goes away during the complex manufacturing process.<br /><br />On its positive side, sucralose is found in thousands of food and beverage products.  It's used because it is a no-calorie sweetener, and does not promote dental cavities.  It's also safe for consumption by diabetics, as it doesn't affect insulin levels, and for some can be a good thing.  Did some checking and the safety of sucralose appears to be well documented in more than 100 scientific studies conducted over a 20-year period.  Sucralose has been reviewed by the FDA, as well as by international health authorities such as the World Health Organization.  It is said to be safe for use by all consumers.<br /><br />But iced tea without sweeteners has no calories, and the same goes for iced coffee.  And above all, plain water, be it from a bottle or from the tap is exempt as well.  I'm no health fanatic, and as a cyclist do often indulge in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UYCZN8"">Gatorade</a> sports drinks, which are said to have a small amount of sucralose, depending on the flavor.  As a personal taste, and this is highly subjective, this one didn't work for me, but I'm not ruling this product family out, as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQJU"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Tropical Citrus</a> may be an improvement in taste.<br /><br />6/21/2012"

I was looking for some nutritious additives, to help put fiber and ingredients that might be good for the heart and the rest of the body, such as lots of omega-3.  Research led me to flax seed, so off I went, to the store and found some.  I started adding it to my cereal for breakfast, my Carnation Instant Breakfast when that's breakfast, my homemade yogurt for my lunch time dessert, my ice cream (OK, an occasional treat that I generally avoid).<br /><br />I found that I like the stuff.  So, when I was getting near to running out of my first pound, instead of buying it at what to me seemed to be inflated prices I decided it was time to check Amazon.com.<br /><br />Wow, am I glad I did.  Four 16 oz bags cost about $5 more than one 16 oz container at the store. I used the subscribe and save option (which I also use for my tea), and it's $13.75 for 64 oz compared to $8 + for 16 at the store.  And this is good stuff.<br /><br />Also, I really like getting Bob's Red Mill because I really respect owner Bob Moore's plans to sell the company to his employees using an employee stock ownership plan.  A really neat thing to do.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this flaxseed meal?  Let's put it this way, I'm giving one of the bags to my Mom, and when I go through the rest, it will be just about time that my subscription sends me more.

That makes it tough to review dog food.  I'm not a nutrition expert...all I can do is comment on my personal experience.<br /><br />First of all, Beneful dog food smells better than MANY popular dog foods.  That is a BIG plus in my book.  If smell is a decent indicator of how appetizing something might be to eat, then I would say Beneful must taste pretty good to the dog.  Any the dog loves it (as much as any dog who occasionally gets human food scraps can ""love"" dog food).  He always sniffs it with interest when presented, and eats it with gusto when he's ready to eat.  When he decides its time to dig in, he'll polish off his bowl.  That's a pretty good indicator to me.  I think Beneful is a good compromise between your standard ""Dog Chow"" and the much more expensive items you see in speciality pet stores.  It is just a little more expensive than the ""common"" stuff, but if you can't afford the price of the top tier food...I think Beneful makes a great alternative for something a bit more flavorful and which (based on information provided, not any ""scientific research"" on my part) has a bit more concern for providing your pooch with a well balanced diet.<br /><br />I think if you've not tried it, it is WELL worth seeing what your dog things."

I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand.

For me, this taste reminds me of my childhood, because part of my mother's family is still in France. She moved here with her sister, when she was 23, met my father,fell in love, and two weeks later they were married. They had my brother and I, and were happily married for almost nineteen years before we devastatingly lost him to melanoma when I was only ten, my brother twelve. My mother and father were 42. Our lives, changed, but were always wonderful because my mother is so loving, nurturing, and attentive. I have wonderful memories of the 4 of us opening a package from my Mem'ere, (my grandmother), and my uncle, who is my mom's brother.<br /> The chocolate was always delicious of coarse, (they don't add wax to their chocolate like we do in the states), but I was always quick to find the Bergamot candy! When I was little the candy came in tins, and there are some sites that sell them in the tins still which are almost identical to the old ones. They used to break the pieces, so they were all different shapes and sizes, but all of them delicious! The sweet, light floral flavor and easily dissolving pieces just seem to melt away. They now come cut, and individually wrapped, so if you want to take a few in your purse you can! :)<br />We also visited France the year my father passed; my mother needed to be with her family for help and support. We stayed for a month, and got to visit Nancy, as well as many other amazing places. We even got to see the home my mother grew up in. My Mem'ere passed away a few years ago at 88 years of age, but my uncle and his 4-year-old son still live there, and we miss them so much. My uncle still sends us packages when he can, and we still open it together as a family. It's still as exciting to me as it was when I was 8. :)<br />I hope everyone enjoys these as much as I do!

Their caloric numbers may be a bit high, but they provide surprising amounts of potassium, protein, and dietary fiber.<br /><br />That being said, these are some of the tastiest cashews that you'll find, and they have no trans fat, either. Must also note that Emerald's ""On the Go"" canister"" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Pros: Good sized cashews (Emerald says they're ""25% larger than that other brand""); very few pieces.

The chocolate does have a bit of that 'healthy' flavor that's familiar in meal replacement/drink mix products. There is a bit of real chocolate taste to it and the texture is satisfying. The bar has a chewy and slightly crunchy consistency. I love that it requires a bit of chewing and has a good enough flavor to enjoy it.<br />I wouldn't consider this a 'snack' though. At 230 calories a bar, it's probably a meal for any one watching their weight, or like me, trying to lose weight. These go great with a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a cold glass of water for lunch.<br />I do feel full for 2-3 hours after eating one of these, sometimes longer.<br />I was a bit disappointed that this 'No Sugar' product had 25 carbs. There is 20 grams of protein to help even it out but only 2 grams of fiber. It'd be nice if these had some extra fiber to them or simply less 'sugar substitute'. I would say as a rough average there's about 17 net carbs per bar. Not bad but I was expecting less, I suppose many people subtract all the sugar alcohols from the total carbs however, maltitol is awfully close to sugar, so I don't feel that would be accurate.<br /><br />I enjoy the flavor of these and will probably keep them in rotation since they do have a nice price compared to other meal bars.<br />I hope ThinkThin expands their flavors, I would love to see what they could do with tropical flavors. Like coconut. (Their lemon one is on my must try list.)<br />Definitely a product I can recommend, for those who like chocolate.<br /><br />--Mine came with an expiration date 11 months away and seemed fresh.

When he was young I fed him Beneful and he did okay for a bit and then he would have medical issues.  Through expensive medical treatment, we would get him back to normal but it was only a short time before the next outbreak.  I tried everything.  Supplement pills, different foods, allergy medication, steroids, limited diet and nothing seemed to work.  He would get better and then back to being bad with him constantly itching, chewing his skin, and he just looked miserable.  It seemed as though this cycle would never end.<br /><br />Then while visiting my brother who owns a collie recommended this food because I kept commenting on how healthy he looked and how soft his fur was.  I was hesitant at first because I had tried so much and nothing had seemed to work.  I gave the Wellness Super5mix whitefish and sweet potato a chance.  All I can say is that he no longer has ANY skin irritations, his fur is shinny and soft, he has a lot more energy, and overall I would say he is in his best health every.  The change came after about 3 weeks of him eating the food.  We use to have to bath him once a week and with the Wellness food we bath him maybe once a month.<br /><br />But I will say this food will not have the same effect for every dog.  As some of the others on here have stated that their dog had loose stool issues and the dogs simply refusing eating the food, this is very true.  My other dog has no allergies what so ever and I figured if it worked for the one dog it should be fine for the other so I would only have to buy one type of food.  The non-allergic dog began eating the Wellness and had immediate issues with loose stool and upset stomach.  So I keep him on his old food which is just the average food you would find in any pet store.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you have exhausted all other efforts.  All I can say is that my dog is in his best health ever and it was only due to a better diet and more attention and with the help of Wellness.  I would recommend this food to anyone who shares similar dog problems as I have experienced."

These are incredibly difficult to find in my local grocery store and market so I buy a case or two from Amazon every other month and keep one at home and one at the office for days when I can't make it out to lunch. With a glass of milk, the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle rolls is great for tiding me over 'til dinner."

They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either."

I will say that it made decent iced coffee later that evening, which did go a long way to improving my opinion of it.<br /><br />The next day I made it my way, and I have to say that it's really excellent coffee.  It's smooth and flavorful without a hint of bitterness.  And the iced coffee was even better this time.

The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  So, I decided to try the Albanese Gummi Rings in Peach for a change.  The consistency is quite gummi and not like a fruit slice, but the flavor just was not what I expected.  They are a tad bit softer than a gummi bear.  I expected a fresh taste like a juicy peach right off the tree.  There is definitely a peach taste, but not a fresh real peach taste.  It is not horrible and I enjoyed them to some extent.  Two gummies at a time were enough, any more and it was too much.  I suppose calorie wise, that is a good thing.<br /><br />I'm going to give these four stars as I do like them, but probably would not buy them again.  I can see other people enjoying these more than me.  I think really that it is a consistency thing.  To compare this to other types of gummi rings, I would say these are definitely better.  If you are a gummi ring lover, I would say that you would enjoy this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of 4.5 pounds each for a total of nine pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  My guests really enjoyed these rings and my stash went very quickly.<br /><br />The gummy rings were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.

Fleck",0,0,5,1321920000,"My puppy loves them.","I like everything about Zuke's treats - the ingredients, no artificial stuff, and they're made in the USA.  They're a good (healthier) alternative to the stuff you can typically find in most retail stores.  They cost more by weight, but they're not really expensive either.  (If you try some and like them, stock up in bulk on Amazon because they're eligible for the free shipping, too!)  And they actually do last a long time - each pound box is a big supply because the treats are small, and my puppy doesn't care that they're small, he just loves eating them.<br /><br />I started using Zuke's Mini Naturals treats when my English Setter puppy was right around 7-8 weeks old when we started training simple obedience, then a few weeks later I ordered the Zuke's Mini Bakes as well.  As far as training goes, I agree with the reviewers who said that it is better to use a small moist treat for early training, as the dog can swallow it quickly and not take extra time to chew it up.  If the puppy is small in size or young, use a moist treat.<br /><br />For a larger puppy that's a little older, these mini bakes work fine for training.  My dog is now 5 months old and ~40 lbs. but he's still a puppy, and he can eat these quickly enough that they are a good training reward.  I still break them in half to make them smaller and make the box last longer.  They're scored across the middle so they break in half pretty easily.<br /><br />We've tried both the Turkey n' Taterz flavor and the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz flavor.  He loves both.  He was a little hesitant to eat the biscuit the first time I offered it.  He sniffed, dropped it on the floor, and sniffed some more before eating it... after tasting it, he gobbled them readily, and continues to enjoy them.<br /><br />If you're wondering just how big these are... ""mini"" is correct.  They measure about 2cm long and 1cm wide, or about 7/8ths in. by 7/16ths in.  Small, but effective.  Recommended."

Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.

For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)"

Save the environment. ( I hate it whenever I throw out used K-Cups in such a good condition, one-time use) 2. Save money. ( Although K-Cups cost much less than a visit to Starbucks, it costs ~$0.43-$0.50  per Cup and it adds up.) 3. I get to choose to brew from any coffee of my choice. ( I can brew from beans purchased in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and etc.). Best of all, brew it right after I grind the beans. Fresh)<br /><br />After My-Kaps arrived, I can't wait to use it to brew the next day.<br />3 reasons that I love them:<br />  1. Thanks to the clear instructions sent with My-Kap, it's easy to get started, assemble and dissemble.<br />  2. The coffee brewed from reused K-Cups with My-Kap tastes great to the essence of your grinds, unlike bad reviews I've read for similar product. Even better,  I can change the strength of my coffee by adding less or more onto my reused K-cup.<br />  3. It does leak but not too much or too messy. I do not know exactly the reason or ways to prevent it from happening. I am still playing with it. But the leaks are not messy because they still go into the cup. I just have to remember to wipe the machine after brewing.  I do that as a routine regardless it leaks anyway, do it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />For the quality of the brewed I get, the money and wastes I saved, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended to anyone who shares my desires to save environment, save $$ and has a freedom to brew different coffee each day. Not just different, but FRESH!! (if you recently grind the beans or grind right before you brew it)"

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I did receive the Barlean's which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn't sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn't have the failed seal under the lid when I opened it.  I appreciate and was impressed by Amazon's response but, to be honest, I have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn't be a problem since it's not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via USPS in this heat is almost certainly going to melt."

With everything it had going for it I figured there had to be a catch. Wheat-Free, Gluten-free, Non-Dairy - I wasn't expecting much in the way of flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that, while it seems subdued, there is flavor and it's alright. I can taste the chocolate & the coconut predominately. As it states on the box, they are ""moist & chewy"". I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat). So much for a healthy ""whenever"" bar.<br /><br />15mg of Cholesterol, 130mg of sodium (yikes), 23g Total Carbohydrates, 2g of dietary fiber, 8g of sugar, 2g of protein.<br /><br />It also states that there are 180mg Omega 3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, & 0 grams trans fats.<br /><br />The numbers above are for 1 bar which = 1 serving.<br /><br />This product contains coconut, eggs, soy, and almonds. It is processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.<br /><br />So this isn't something I would personally chose to get again. They're alright in terms of flavor but they just seem to have too much of a downside when inspecting the label."

I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees."

I made this cake to try at accommodating some family members that are gluten free.<br /><br />As a cake baker, this cake is mediocre. The texture of the batter is gritty (what do you expect when it uses only rice flour?!), but may be because I didn't throw it all in as the instructions said. I was worried that throwing in a stick of butter and eggs with the water and mix would yield a weird texture itself. However, it baked well. I found that it cracked on top though and it is so dense and heavy. This is not a light cake by any means, and if you're trying to make a layered cake, you have to be careful as it will crack easily and really feels like it will just crumble in your hands if you're handling it. The taste is just ok. It has an ok texture and decent moistness, but the moistness borderlines an undercooked taste, in my opinion. When you cut it, it falls apart and pulls if you aren't just cutting straight down. Mine definitely doesn't look like the picture on the box!<br /><br />I would say that if you have to be gluten free and have no other option, this might be a good quick cake for you. I think there are other choices that may taste and act more like a 'real' cake if you find the recipe. There are multiple gluten free blogs that have yummy looking and sounding cake recipes (which I intend to test). Why not a coconut flour cake? Or a combination flour cake? Rice flour alone is not my first choice."

I contacted their customer service and they were very apologetic and admitted to a quality control problem with some of their early run k-cups.  They quickly sent out a replacement box - and in addition - a second box of Corner Donut Shop. We have had no problems at all with these and I am very pleased with the taste of the Donut Shop blend as it is more bold than the Brooklyn Bridge (which my wife prefers).

Most non-Cantonese Chinese rarely consume it and certainly do not cook it.  Char-Siu is ever slightly crunchy outside and is moist and tender inside.  The sauce is sweet and tangy with a touch of saltiness to it.  It is different from the American Southern barbecue which is slow smoked for hours, nor it is like the Coastal barbecue which is grilled on direct flames for minutes.  It sits in between.  The cook time is about 1-2 hours.  The cooking temperature also sit in between the Southern and Coastal barbecue.  You can eat it by itself.  You can eat it as part of a meal.  Of course, it is THE essential ingredient of the infamous Char-Siu Bao (Chinese BBQ pork buns).  When you eat a real good Char Siu, you just want to run home and kiss your mom.<br /><br />I am born and raised in Hong Kong.  I have tasted countless authentic Char-Siu for decades.  I know how to make my own Char-Siu sauce from scratch, but it takes time.  I still encourage people to at least make their sauce once, just to appreciate the ingredients.  There is no absolute recipe for Char-Siu sauce, but it must contains sugar, vinegar, honey, salt and soy paste.  Some people make their Char-Siu sauce from Hosin sauce since they share many ingredients.<br /><br />This Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce is authentic -- not because I say so, but because its existence proves its authenticity.  Lee Kum Kee is a very famous Hong Kong brand which dedicates in making sauces.  Its trademark staple product is the  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX1E"">Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>.  Actually, that is an understatement.  Oyster sauce, in fact, is invented by Lee Kam Sheung, who then founded the company: Lee Kum Kee.  (Oyster sauce is another product mostly enjoyed by Cantonese Chinese).  This company made its sauces to satisfy Hong Kong residents who do not have time to make their own sauces.  These Lee Kum Kee sauces would have never survived if they are not authentic and accepted by the Hong Kong residents.<br /><br />I uploaded two pictures of my Char-Siu made with this sauce as customer images.  By no mean, my Char-Siu is perfected.  However, I hope to show that one can achieve good Char-Siu by using this sauce as the main ingredient.<br /><br />I have used this Char-Siu sauce for more than 15 years, and have also tried other brands in between.  I encourage others to try other brands as well.  Lee Kum Kee Char-Siu sauce is not the only good one out there, but it is definitely one of the best."

Frank",3,3,5,1234224000,"Reading the label makes ME hungry!","So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too."

The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a ""cinnamon roll"" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.

We also now need to teach her patience, slight portion control techniques (""One at a time, sweetie!"" works fine, thankfully!), and taking one's time to enjoy their food.  :)  Here are our thoughts:<br />1) Lightly sweetened, when compared to other brands and flavors.  In fact, I'm pretty sensitive to over-sweetened foods, and I likened these to regular Cheerios with a hint of sugar and other flavors.<br />2) I'm able to interpret the toughest of often-unpronouncable ingredients found in many ""food"" products these days, but that's just me since it has a tie to my current occupation.  So, I was surprised at how simple and straightforward the ingredient list is; I'd encourage purchase of this organic product based upon that alone (assuming that the company is truthful in its advertising).  Although our child appears to eat whatever is placed in front of her (this is her daddy's sense of adventure already poking through), I'm not worried about her getting enough greens into her developing body; however, if your child is fussy about veggies, this could be a nice substitute until you find a more creative way to blend in greens into the child's diet (current articles appear to lean more towards ""trickery,"" ""disguising,"" and ""entertaining"" the child when it comes to getting them to eat foods which we ordinarily would have had forced down our throats -so to speak- when we were little!).  This product may partially solve that issue.<br />3) Like competitor brands, this product does ""melt"" into a newly teething baby's mouth within an appropriate amount of time whether it's chewed or sucked upon by the baby, rendering it less of a choking hazard if you're concerned about that as we once were.<br />4) The container itself contains more product per container than do its competitors, which is quite nice.  Depending upon where you purchase a competitor brand, this one may be slightly higher per ounce, but it's worth it.  We don't forsee a need to purchase another case until 1-2 months pass.<br />5) The containers themselves are rather durable.  Unless your child is body-slamming it to the ground or you're stepping on it with all your weight, don't count on it shattering easily at all.  Plus, it's conveniently recyclable, and the opening is not too flimsy and snaps closed well enough."

The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach.  Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds.  The  healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect.  Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds.  Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache.  Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation.""

Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.

It's great to eat dry, as a snack or in a bowl of milk.<br /><br />As far as the nutritional part goes, it's not too bad.  A serving size is 3/4 of a cup and is 120 calories with 3.5 grams of fat.

Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as ""gluten free"".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well."

Despite warnings that a conventional electric oven is a poor way to roast coffee, it was all I had till my popcorn popper arrives.  I used a wire-mesh pizza screen over a ceramic ""pizza stone"" to roast the beans.<br /><br />I preheated the oven to 500F and let it stabilize for nearly ten minutes, while I spread the beans in a single layer over the pizza screen, taking care to reach beneath the screen and push any beans back up onto the surface of the screen before placing them on the stone.  Any beans slightly poking through the screen will be stuck there and difficult to remove after roasting without pulverizing them (they swell when roasted).<br />Next I placed the screen onto the stone.  The idea was to use the stone to even out the electric oven's heat, and to ensure as uniform a roast as possible.<br />I quickly opened the oven to rotate the mesh screen 15 to 20 degrees at 90 second to two-minute intervals.  (You can easily move the screen without burning your fingers by using a pair of table-wear forks.)  I listened for the first crack, and waited till about midway through the second crack to remove the screen and dump the roasted beans into a mesh colander over the sink, where I agitated them vigorously to remove the chaff and cool the beans.<br />If further cooling is needed the beans can be placed back onto the cooled pizza screen and suspended between two raised objects to allow air to circulate around the beans.<br /><br />I was delighted with the medium roast of the beans!  I made a large Americano with the espresso machine . . . my son commented that his coffee actually tasted sweet in the aftertaste.<br /><br />If oven-roasting turned out this good, I am excited to discover what roasting beans over the stove in the (purchased from Amazon!) popcorn popper may produce.<br /><br />Excellent beans, great flavor and aroma.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Purchased the Great Northern Stainless Steel popper from Amazon . . . and I am very pleased with the roasted beans.  It took some experimentation (and some mistakes) to learn how to get the most uniform roast from the popper.<br />Here's what I learned, in a nutshell:<br />1)  Preheat the popper on the lower end of ""Medium"" (electric stove) for a couple of minutes.<br />2)  Put in between 1 and 2 cups of beans, and begin turning the lever.  I give it three moderately slow turns (just a little less than one full turn/second, times 3) then 4 turns as fast as I can, then repeat the three moderately slow turns, then 4 fast turns, etc.  I think it may be a little better to take a very brief jag backward on the turn before taking the 4 fast ones--the beans sometimes stick under the agitator blades, and this shakes them loose.<br />Why the three slow then four fast turns?  Because the beans tend to rest on their flat sides, and just slide around on the bottom of the popper, getting dark on the bottom flat side and a bit too light on the rounded side of the beans.  The four fast turns agitates them and makes the beans more uniform.  If you don't believe this, try it both ways.<br />Agitate as above through the first crack, and as the second crack begins, pop one side of the lid open and dump the beans into your colander for cooling/de-chaffing.<br />That's it.<br />I get results quite similar to the commercial roaster we have a few miles away."

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

To make your coffee even more delicious using the Senseo machine, always remember to run the machine once without any coffee.  After doing so, immediately brew using this Sumatra coffee, and it will be extra foamy and delicious."

I also grew up Coconut milk, so I was pretty excited about this product.  However, after drinking it... it doesn't meet any of my expectations. It doesn't taste like Coconut  and simply tastes really watered down.  In fact, it tastes like you're just drinking water... very plain.  It wasn't very sweet or flavorful. I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart, but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk, I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up, drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.  Nothing beats that experience... the real deal. Plus, it's better for the environment... no plastic containers or trash to worry about. Plus, it tastes so much better than this product."

My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.

226698,"B004AE1FHY","A29N66WIWNN8JK","One Reviewer",0,0,5,1337299200,"My Personal Favorite Instant Coffee","This is my personal favorite instant coffee. To me, it has a fuller flavor than other instant coffee brands I've tried. But, since taste varies widely from person to person, it's subjective to the drinker. I prefer my coffee with creamer and sweetener. If I didn't use creamer, I think that it would be too bitter for my taste as opposed to regular ground/perked coffee. I began using instant coffee for a couple of reasons. First, I would either perk too much, or perk too little. It was just too difficult for me to predict how much or how little coffee I would want during the day. The second reason is, it's quick. We have a hot/cold water dispenser and it's super easy to fix myself a quick cup. The majority of my friends are non-coffee drinkers and prefer tea. So, when I visit them, it's easy to carry along a premeasured amount of instant coffee to enjoy while visiting. I still perk regular coffee every now and then (Folgers), as there is a distinct difference between intant and perked coffee. Strangely, since I have been drinking more instant than perked, I have found that I am slightly favoring the instant over perked. If you have never had instant coffee, or tried Folgers Instant coffee, I imagine you could request a free sample packet from the company first to see if you like it before making a big purchase.<br /><br />This is much better than dirt and water, by a long shot."
